		<h3>Warm-up exercise!</h3>
		<br />
		<p><strong>Your mission:</strong></p>
		<br />
		<p>Find a way to shake the hand of every person in the room in the shortest time possible, but in a way that you can be confident you really did shake everyone's hand.</p>
		<br />
		<p class='fragment'>What are some approaches you came up with?</p>

	<section>
		<h3>What is an algorithm?</h3>

		<p>An <strong>algorithm</strong> is an explicit, precise, unambiguous, mechanically-executable sequence of elementary instructions.</p>

		<br />

		<p>The word derives from the name of the 9th century Persian mathematician al-Khwarizmi.
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>What is an algorithm?</h3>

<p>Is this sequence of instructions from the gnomes on South Park an algorithm?</p>

		<pre><code>
Step 1: Collect underpants.

Step 2: ????

Step 3: Profit!
		</code></pre>

		<p class='fragment'><strong>Verdict: No, this is not an algorithm. Step 2 is not specific, and a machine could not execute it.</strong></p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>What is an algorithm?</h3>

		<p>Is this sequence of instructions for taking out money from the ATM an algorithm?</p>
		<pre><code>
Step&nbsp;1: Insert card into ATM.

Step&nbsp;2: Type your PIN on keypad.

Step&nbsp;3: Enter an amount to withdraw less than your total balance.

Step&nbsp;4: Receive money.
		</code></pre>

		<p class='fragment'><strong>Verdict: Yes, this is an algorithm.</strong></p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>What is an algorithm?</h3>

		<p>Is this sequence of instructions from my shampoo bottle an algorithm?</p>

		<pre><code>
Step 1: Lather.

Step 2: Rinse.

Step 3: Repeat.
		</code></pre>

		<p class='fragment'><strong>Verdict: No, this is not an algorithm. Step 3 is ambiguous: what do we repeat, and until when?</strong></p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Exercise!</h3>
		<p><strong>Your mission: Think!</strong></p>
		<br />
		<p>What are some algorithms from your everyday life?</p>
		<br />
		<p>What are some algorithms you've encountered while programming?</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Why bother learning algorithms?</h3>
		<h4>a.k.a. Why are you here?</h4>

		<ul>
			<li class='fragment'>It's like weight lifting for your brain. Exercise the muscles now so that they're ready to use when you need them.</li>
			<li class='fragment'>It will help you think of techniques for solving problems.</li>
			<li class='fragment'>It will expose you to some classic problems in computer science, which are often referenced in articles, tech talks, and interview questions.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>How to solve a problem with an algorithm</h3>

		<p class='fragment'><strong>1. State the problem formally.</strong></p>

		<br />
		<p class='fragment'>Be as clear as possible. Use generalized variables instead of specific examples or instances of the problem.</p>

		<br />
		<p class='fragment'><strong>Bad:</strong> Sort some numbers like \((51, 62, 27, 3, 94)\).</p>
		<p class='fragment'><strong>Good:</strong> Sort an array of integers \(A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots A_{n}\).</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Exercise!</h3>
		<p>Can you transform this loosely-defined instance of a problem into a well-defined statement of a more generic problem?<p>
		<br />
		<p class='fragment'>Let's say I gave you five blocks with the weights of 1 pound, 2 pounds, 5 pounds, 8 pounds, and 10 pounds, respectively. Could you fill a sack with blocks so that its weight is exactly 21 pounds?</p>
		<br />
		<p class='fragment'>Interested in thinking more about this? It's called the "Knapsack Problem".</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>How to solve a problem with an algorithm</h3>

		<p class='fragment'>
			<strong>2. Find a solution to the problem*</strong>
			<br />
			<small>* Note: this step in particular makes this list NOT an algorithm</small>
		</p>

		<br />
		<p class='fragment'>You might solve the problem using known techniques, ingenuity, or a little bit of both.</p>

		<br />
		<p class='fragment'>Find a way to express your solution to others, perhaps through the use of <strong>pseudocode</strong>.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Pseudocode</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class='fragment'>Uses the structure of formal programming languages and mathematics.</li>
			<li class='fragment'>Breaks algorithms down into primitive steps.</li>
			<li class='fragment'>The primitive steps may be written using mathematics, pure English, or an appropriate mixture of the two.</li>
			<li class='fragment'>Reveals the internal structure of the algorithm but hides irrelevant implementation details.</li>
			<li class='fragment'>Makes the algorithm much easier to understand, analyze, debug, and implement.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Pseudocode</h3>

		<p>Here is an algorithm for singing "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall", for arbitrary values of 99:</p>

		<br />
		<p class='fragment'>BottlesOfBeer(\(n\)):</p>
		<pre class='fragment'><code>
For i &larr; n down to 1
  Sing "i bottles of beer on the wall, i bottles of beer,"
  Sing "Take one down, pass it around,"
  Sing "i âˆ’ 1 bottles of beer on the wall."
Sing "No bottles of beer on the wall, no bottles of beer,"
Sing "Go to the store, buy some more, n bottles of beer on the wall."
		</code></pre>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Handshake problem</h3>

		<p>Find a way to shake the hand of every person in the room in the shortest time possible, but in a way that you can be confident you really did shake everyone's hand.</p>

		<br />

		<p class='fragment'>
			One possible solution:
			<br /><br />
			Stand in two parallel lines facing each other. Shake hands with the person in front of you. Take a step to the left, where the last person at the end of the line moves to the beginning of the other line. Continue this process until you have shaken everyone's hand.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Handshake problem</h3>
		<p>Let's express it with pseudocode!</p>

		<br />
		<p>HandshakeWithEveryone(\(P[1 .. n]\)):</p>

		<pre><code>
&lang;&lang;i represents the number of people you still need to shake hands with&rang;&rang;
for i &larr; n down to 2
	&lang;&lang;shake hands&rang;&rang;
	line1 &larr; P[1 .. n/2]
	line2 &larr; P[n/2 + 1 .. n]
	ShakeHands(line1, line2);

	&lang;&lang;shift over one, and wrap the last guy&rang;&rang;
	P&rsquo;[n] = P[1]
	for j &larr; n down to 2
	&nbsp;	P&rsquo;[j-1] = P[j]
	P &larr; P&rsquo;
		</code></pre>

		<aside class='notes'>
			<ul>
				<li>Mention implementation details: Assuming n is even</li>
				<li>Mention time it takes to run ShakeHands</li>
			</ul>
		</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Exercise!</h3>

		<p>Write pseudocode that prints the lyrics of the song "BINGO" for arbitrary long names of dogs.</p>

		<em>
		<br />There was a farmer who had a dog
		<br />And BINGO was his name-o
		<br />B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O
		<br />And BINGO was his name-o
		<br />There was a farmer who had a dog
		<br />And BINGO was his name-o
		<br />(clap)-I-N-G-O, (clap)-I-N-G-O, (clap)-I-N-G-O
		<br />...
		</em>
		<p class='fragment'>Hint: FarmerHadADog(\(B[1 .. n]\)))</p>

	<section>
		<h3>How to solve a problem with an algorithm</h3>

		<p class='fragment'><strong>3. Prove your algorithm is correct.</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li class='fragment'>We must convince our audience (and ourselves!) that the algorithm actually does what it's supposed to do.</p>
			<li class='fragment'>The algorithm must be correct for <em>all possible</em> inputs.  It's not enough to show that the algorithm does the right thing on some example input.</li>
			<li class='fragment'>Usually requires a formal, mathematical proof of correctness.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Mathematical proofs</h3>

		<p class='fragment'>Just kidding. We're totally not going to cover this today; it would need a class of its own.</p>

		<p class='fragment'>In lieu of knowing how to construct formal proofs, you can do a few other things in practice:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class='fragment'>Try to reason, even informally, about why your algorithm is correct.</li>
				<li class='fragment'>Explain your algorithm to a peer. Having to state something clearly enough that someone else understands it is helpful, as is a peer's input.</li>
				<li class='fragment'>If you're coding, write unit tests that cover all possible inputs.</li>
			</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>How to solve a problem with an algorithm</h3>

		<p class='fragment'><strong>4. Analyze the runtime of your algorithm.</strong></p>

		<p class='fragment'>TODO!</p>
